# I never share my code... 
...as I started out my tech career doing eavesdropping and re-routing communications and this taught me that everything I share is a risk but now... as a student, lover and purveyor of python and ai spells, I wish to share something so you know who I am.  Therefore this is my opensource love project. ðŸ’—  Feel free to join in by messaging me here on Github or -> https://linkedin.com/in/alanhelmick
